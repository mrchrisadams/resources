Hey there,

Thanks for signing up to participate in our study! Our team is looking forward to hearing from you. There's just one bit of research hygiene we need to cover beforehand.

Attached to this email is an agreement explaining the kind of information my teammates and I are looking for and how we'll use what we collect. Your participation in this study is greatly appreciated; this agreement explains the steps we'll take to ensure your privacy.

The long and short is that researchers at [agency] like to record and take notes during our interviews. We delete the raw video recordings whenever our study concludes (typically after two weeks). 

At the end of each study, our office often makes "highlight reels" of anonymous feedback to help people understand the highs and lows of the experience created by way of the digital service we're designing. 

Could you please read this agreement over, ask any questions you might have, and sign/return it?

Thanks,
[Name]
